# RWA version 6

This clone is specifically for Cypress v6 of the [Cypress Real World App](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-realworld-app)

## Getting Started

The Cypress Real-World App (RWA) is a full-stack Express/React application backed by a local JSON database ([lowdb]).

The app is bundled with [example data](./data/database.json) (`data/database.json`) that contains everything you need to start using the app and run tests out-of-the-box.

> ðŸš© **Note**
>
> You can login to the app with any of the [example app users](./data/database.json#L2). The default password for all users is `s3cret`.  
> Example users can be seen by running `yarn list:dev:users`.

### Prerequisites

The only requirement for this project is to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) **version 12** installed on your machine. Refer to the [.node-version](./.node-version) file for the exact version.

TypeScript will be added as a local dependency to the project, so no need to install it.

### Installation

```shell
yarn install
```

### Run the app

```shell
yarn dev
```

### Start Cypress

```shell
yarn cypress:open
```

## Tests

| Type | Location                                 |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------- |
| api  | [cypress/tests/api](./cypress/tests/api) |
| ui   | [cypress/tests/ui](./cypress/tests/ui)   |
| unit | [`src/__tests__`](./src/__tests__)       |

## Database

- The local JSON database located in [data/database.json](./data/database.json) and is managed with [lowdb].

- The database is [reseeded](./data/database-seed.json) each time the application is started (via `yarn dev`). Database seeding is done in between each [Cypress End-to-End test](./cypress/tests).

- Updates via the React frontend are sent to the [Express][express] server and handled by a set of [database utilities](backend/database.ts)

- Generate a new database using `yarn db:seed`.

- An [empty database seed](./data/empty-seed.json) is provided along with a script (`yarn start:empty`) to view the application without data.

## Additional NPM Scripts

| db:seed        | Generates fresh database seeds for json files in /data              |
| start:empty    | Starts backend, frontend and Cypress with empty database seed       |
| tsnode         | Customized ts-node command to get around react-scripts restrictions |

## Code Coverage Report

The Cypress Real-World App uses the [@cypress/code-coverage](https://github.com/cypress-io/code-coverage) plugin to generate code coverage reports for the app frontend and backend.

To generate a code coverage report:

1. Run `yarn cypress:run --env coverage=true` and wait for the test run to complete.
2. Once the test run is complete, you can view the report at `coverage/index.html`.
